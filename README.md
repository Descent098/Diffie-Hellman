# Diffie-Hellman

A [Diffe-Helmen Key Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) in Rust & Python. Mostly did this to learn more about the algorithm since i'm taking a security class, and also to try transpiling python to rust. Please dear God don't use this in production.
